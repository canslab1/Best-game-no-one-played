# A Mixed Opinion Dynamics and Innovation Diffusion Model for Exploring the ‘Best Game No One Played’ Phenomenon

## Abstract
The “best game no one played” refers to innovative products that receive favorable reviews but never catch on with consumers. We combined an adoption threshold model with an opinion dynamics model to examine why certain high-quality products and ideas never achieve expected levels of success. Most studies using opinion dynamics models focus on opinion exchanges without discussing follow-up actions, most using adoption threshold models only examine ways that individual decisions depend on proportions of friends and neighbors already engaged in specific behaviors, regardless of opinion differences. Four network types (regular lattice, random, small-world, scale-free) were used as underlying social network structures for agent-based simulations designed to analyze opinion exchange dynamics and product acceptance. Results indicate that computational agents were capable of changing pro/con opinions about products and ideas when communicating with neighboring agents, and of making acceptance/rejection choices based on an adoption threshold plus observations of neighboring agent behaviors. Sensitivity analysis simulation experiments were performed to determine which factors exerted the greatest influence or required the greatest care when applied to cases of innovation diffusion. Agent adoption threshold mean exerted the strongest influence, followed by agent attitude mean and bounded confidence.
